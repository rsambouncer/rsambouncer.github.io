        <h2><a href="java-files">Java Files</a></h2>
        <p>This is a collection of short challenges and algorithms that I wrote in Java. 
            Most of these were written when I was in 8th and 9th grade (2015-2017).

        <h2><a href="https://rsambouncer.neocities.org/english-final">English 10H Final Project</a></h2>
        <p>For my english semester 1 final, I built a website from scratch with my limited knowledge of HTML and CSS.
            I handled the website building, the game, and a small portion of the analysis. 
            My partner did the rest of the literary analysis.

        <h2><a href="https://rsambouncer.neocities.org/shooty_thingy/popup.html">Shooty Game</a></h2>
        <p>This is one of the first games that I tried to write. I spent most of 9th grade writing this. 
            It is buggy, laggy, and ugly, but it is one of my favorite projects.
            I abandoned this version of the project for a version with different game mechanics, and that could be scaled to multiplayer.

            The main page is "popup.html" rather than "index.html", because this was origonally made as a chrome extension. 
            At this time, the extension is not available for download.

        <h2><a href="https://rsambouncer.neocities.org/maze/popup.html">Maze Game</a></h2>
        <p>This is my first game. In 8th grade, I was interested in maze generation. 
            By myself, I developed two algorithms for generating mazes, 
            which I later learned were called Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. 
            Learning the names of the algorithms that I had "invented" was a little saddening, but exciting at the same time. 
            This is actually how I was introduced to graph theory.

        <h2><a href="https://25590.000webhostapp.com">lightBulb</a></h2>
        <p>This was my first attempt at having a webpage communicate over the web. 
            If you click the lightbulb, it will change for everyone who has the webpage open, not just you. 
            To accomplish this &#60;sarcasm&#62;monumental&#60;&#47;sarcasm&#62; feat, it took me a week of searching the internet, and and another week of learning about AJAX requests and PHP.
            It took me so long because I didn't have any idea what I was doing (and I am self-taught - I've never had a more confused teacher).

        <h2><a href="https://real-time-cursor.herokuapp.com/">Websocket Cursor Tracking</a></h2>
        <p>This was my second attempt at having a webpage communicate over the web, which I made to learn how websockets work. 
            This front-end application draws a square where your cursor is. Actually, it draws squares where everone's cursors are.
            You can test this by opening the page in multiple tabs or on another computer.

        <p>I made Multiplayer Cookie Clicker at Code Day LA, on November 11-12, 2017. The artwork is obviously not my own.
