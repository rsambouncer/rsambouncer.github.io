        <p>A collection of short challenges and algorithms that I wrote in Java. 
            Most of these were written when I was in 8th and 9th grade (2015-2017).

        <p>For my english semester 1 final, I built a website from scratch with my limited knowledge of HTML and CSS.
            I handled the website building, the game, and a small portion of the analysis. 
            My partner did the rest of the literary analysis.

        <h2><a href="https://rsambouncer.neocities.org/shooty_thingy/popup.html">Shooty game</a></h2>
        <p>This is one of the first games that I tried to write. I spent most of 9th grade writing this. 
            It is buggy, laggy, and ugly, but it is one of my favorite projects.
            I abandoned this version of the project for a version with different game mechanics, and that could be scaled to multiplayer.

            The main page is "popup.html" rather than "index.html", because this was origonally made as a chrome extension. 
            At this time, the extension is not available for download.

        <h2><a href="https://rsambouncer.neocities.org/maze/popup.html">Maze Game</a></h2>
        <p>This is my first game. In 8th grade, I was interested in maze generation. 
            By myself, I developed two algorithms for generating mazes, 
            which I later learned were called Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. 
            Learning the names of the algorithms that I had "invented" was a little saddening, but exciting at the same time. 
            This is actually how I was introduced to graph theory.
