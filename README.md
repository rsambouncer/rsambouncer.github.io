# Old personal website

In high school, this was combination of my personal website, and random files that I didn't know where else to store. Listed below are a few highlights from this repo.
### gymtimebot.js
A bot that would remind one of my group chats to go to the gym.
### Tabby-thingy-2
One of my first ever projects was a chrome extension that made a custom new tab page. The original source code has been lost to time, but the crx file is still here.
### portfolio
This is just a collection of random Java programs that I made when I was learning how to code. Among them is a collection of sorting algorithms and a bajillion USACO practice solutions.
### patriotUI
This is a bootstrap website, made to assist in code generation for an IOT project. Basically a clickible interface for writing "policies" that constrained the behavior of IOT devices.
